Quintilian and the Dialogus, while the same general point

appear in both writers. This makes it almost certain that,
ii Tacitus was not, like his intimate friend the younger
Pliny, an actual pupil of Quintilian, he was at least
a member ol the same literary circle. Direct indebtedness
to Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria is out oi the question, as
that work was not published till aiter the Dialogus.
