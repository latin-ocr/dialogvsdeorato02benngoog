recitaverat, cum offendisse potentium animos diceretur,
tamquam in eo tragoediae argumento sui oblitusotantum
Catonem cogitasset, eaque de re per urbem frequens
sermo haberetur, venerunt ad eum M. Aper et lulius
Secundus, celeberrima tum ingenia forinostri, quos
ego utrosque non in iudiciis modo studiose audiebam,
sed domi quoque et in publico adsectabar mira studio-

dealt with the fateor Cato Uticen-
= sis, who committed suicide at
Utica in 46 sc. to avoid falling
into the hands of Julius Caesar.—
recitaverat: see 9. 6 n.-po-
tentium: ie. the Emperor Ves-
, pasian and his advisers. Although
a mild ruler, Vespasian was severe
Ἴ toward those who spoke freely in
criticism of the imperial re'gime.
Thus he banished and afterwards
put to death Helvidius Priscus,
besides expelling the philosophers
oi the Stoic and Cynic schools.—

in Gaul, as appears from 10. 3, and
had risen to senatorial rank and
the praetorship. See Intr. p. xv.
-lulius Secundus: like Aper,
aman oi Gallie origin. He was
a friend of Quintilian, who in X.
3. 12 calls him mirae facundiae
uirum, infinitae tamen curae. In
another passage, X. r. 120, Quin·
tilian charges him with caring more
for style than thought. See Intr.
p. xvi.

a. ingenia: on the use oi
ingenium in the sense of man os

in eo tragoediae argumento: genius ef. Hist. Ι. 1 niagno illa

i.e. in eius tragoediae argumento—
tamquam, on the ground thot, as
frequently in Tacitus. The suij.
in such cases is the same as that
with quad, quia,— representing the
thought as in the mind of some
one else than the writes-sui
oblitus, eto, that sorgetting him·
self (ie. iorgetting what was fitting
and proper), lae had been thinking
of nothing but Cato (ie. aiming to
present the character of Cato).
On the use oi the acc. with eogi-
tare, instead oi de with the abl,
cf. 36. 1 rem cogitant,· Agr. 3²
maiores vestros et posteros cogitate.
- Μ. Aper: nothing is known of
Aper beyond what is said oi him
in the Dialogus. He was born

ingenia cessere.— quos utrosque:
instead oi the usual quorum utrum-
que-studiorum cupiditate, with
a passionate interest in their pur-
suita-fabulas, corroersation; a

post-Augustan sense of the word3 ¹

cf. 29. 5 praeceptores cum auditori-
bnssobulas habeut. Earlier writers
use serma- disputationes: as
for example that described in the
Dialogus iudi—arcana semo·
tae dictionis: apparently the mys-
teries of their private rehearsals,
though neither dictio nor semotus
occurs elsewhere in this sense. “
