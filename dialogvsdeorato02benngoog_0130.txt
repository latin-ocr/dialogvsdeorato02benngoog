bnt the manuscript reading has been restored in many instantes,
and the spelling modified in accordance with the results oi the most
recent studies. In the commentary an effert has been made to
show the development oi prose Latin since Cicer03 but the dis
tinctive aim has been to present a complete and connected vieon
the reign oi Tiberius, and to traee and explain the successive stages
in the deterioration oi his character, from the wisa and humane
ruler oi his earlier years to the gloomy and suspicions tyrant with
whom allareiamiliarr to that end, the break in tha narrative,
caused hy the loss of parts oi the fiith and sixth Boohs, has been
filled by citatione from Dio Cassius, Suetonius, and other writers.

THE plan oi the Collega Series contemplates at present two vol-

nmes oi Livy, one containing Books I. and lI.‚ the other Books
XXI. and XXII. The first volume, which is now ready, hasbeen
edited byProiessor Greenough in accordance with his well-known
views on the teaching oi Latin. The fact that Livy is commonly
read by ireshmen -that is, by studente who are still engaged in
learning to read Latin -has been kept steadily in view. Histori-
cal questions have been treated with sufficient iulness ior intelligent
reading3 but the discussion oi them hasbeen made subordinate to
the presentation oi Livy’s exact ideas in the form in which they
lay in 'his mind, and in the precise order in which in their parts
and their totality he intended to present them. The character oi
early Roman history and Livy’s quality as a historian, together
with his style and Latinity, are treated in the Introduction.
