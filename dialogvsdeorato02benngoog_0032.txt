In earlier days too it used to be the custom for a young
man preparing for the oratorical profession to attach himself
to some jurist or advocate, to follow him day by day,in
court and before the people, and thus learn his profession
by practical experience. Today, complains Messalla, it is
the fashion td declaim suasoriae and controverszoe in the ἵ
school of some rhetor, —with results that are too well known ³
to require further comment. (The speech breaks off in a
lacuna.) ἵ

Sacurvuus’s Seneca (36-40. 1.-The first part of the ;
speech is lost in the lacuna). Secundus gives an historical ,
review of the causes leading to the development of oratory Ἴ
at Rome, viz. the strife of parties and the general political
restlessness which agitated the state. Oratory was favored
too by the mode of procedure in the courts. Liberal tinne
used to be alforded for speaking, and the number of counsel
was not limited‚ whereas today every sort of restriction and
impediment confronts the advocate. (The speech breaks
oft in a lacuna.) ¹

Mn'runrvus's Cnosrrrc Seneca (40. 2 to end).-The first
part is lost. Referring to Secundus's last remarks, Maternus
shows from them that eloquence is the child of discord,
turbulence, and violence, that its existence is consequently
an index of unsettled political conditions and defective
government. Why, therefore, should we deplore its deca-
dence? Let us enjoy the advantages of our own. time,
and not regret the lack of what we do not need.
