INTRODUCTION. xvii

vnsnmns Massmm was a born Roman and a de

3¹³³ scendant of one of Rome’s most illustrious families. He
5²²* was soldier, historian, and orator, winning his greatest ’
successes in the last-named field. -His general position was
Ὺ one of admiration tor the past. He laments the prevailing

passage to Maternus; others put chapters 36-40. 1 in the
mouth of Secundus, assuming a lacuna before the words
non de otiosa et quieta rc loquimur in 40. 2, and allow
Maternus’s closing remarks to begin at that point. This
latter view is plausible for two reasons :-

1. If we assign the entire passage from chapter36 to the end
of chapter 41 to Maternus we meet with ¹numerous irrelevant
repetitions and inconsistencies. Thus it we attribute the
