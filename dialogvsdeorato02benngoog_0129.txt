WHILE this book takes due account oi the literature which has

grown up about Horace, it is meant to bo distinotly a study
oi the poet himself, and is intended especially for tha college class·
room. The commentary assumes that the render is at a somewhat
advanced period in his Latin studies. Mattcrs oi grammatical
detail occupy therefore a very subordinate place-except so iar
as Horaoe’s Latinity marks an important stage in the development
oi the language, or is a conscious deviation ior specific purposes
from the ordinary literary usages. On the other hand, the effert
ismade to traca the motivo and sequence oi thought in each dis·
course and letter, and thus to emphasize Horace’s reflectione upon
Roman society at one oi its great turning-points, end to make clear
the poet’s system oi conduct and lite.

The Brutus of Olocro.

Edited by Professor Mearm hunone ol the University ot Galiiornia.
us. mmmm..

IN the Bratas, which was composed in 46 nc. and purports to

be a conversation with Atticus and Brutus, Cicero traces the
development of oratory among the Romans down to his own time,
with critical notioes oi about two hundred speakers. The long
catalogue isrelieved of dryness by the dialogus form, the freedom
of digression, and by Cicero's fresh arrd teeming style.

Professor Kellogg hos edited the work especially ior college reod-
ing. The Introduction touches upon points oi interest to those to
whom Cicero is uo stranger‚ and contains a full conspectus. The

notes deal with the subjectmatter, historical relations, and diction
oi the dialogus rather than with the commonplaoes oi grammar.

Parallel passages are ireely given, especially from Cicero's other
rhetorical works ond from Quintilian.
