CRITICAL APPENDIX.

Δ. Tne Mnuuscnrrrs.

Tire MSS. of the Dialogus are all descended from a single codex
supposed to have been written in the 13th century, and discovered about
1457 by one Enoch ot Ascoli‚ a papal monh, probably at the monastery
of Hersfeld in Hesse. The MSS. fall into two families, usually desig·
nated by X and Y. To the Xclass belong:

A Vaticanus 1862.

B Leidensis, the second hand ol which is designated as b.

To the Y family belongz

E ottobonianus.

V Vindobonensis 711.

C Famesianus.

Δ Vaticanus 4498.

D Vaticanus 1518.

Α iew others oi inferior value.

Till latelyscholars gave the preference to the x-class, but the tendency
ol recent study has been to recognize the worth oi the Ylamily.
