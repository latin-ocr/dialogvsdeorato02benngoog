INTRODUCTION. xiii

' The above evidence may be briefly summarized as follows :
The MSS. are unanimous in ascribing the work to Tacitus ;
a comparison of diction, syntax, and style shows a number

of striking resemblances that can hardly be fortuitous3
while the general point oi view ot the writer of the Dialogus
and ol the works admitted to have been written by Tacitus, is
the same. Moreover, nothing inconsistent with the Tacitean
authorship ol the Dialogus can be advanced beyond the
discrepancy oi style. Both the dramatic date ol the
dialogue itself and the probable date of composition and
publication tally perfectly with what we know ol Tacitus
Under these circumstances we may saiely accept the view
that Tacitus was the author.

As regards the difference ‘in style between the Dialogus
and Tacitus’s later works we must consider not only the
difference in subject matter, but also the difference in time
of composition. The most ¹probable date lor the com-
position and publication of the Dialogus is 81 nn. From
then until the publication of the Aunols in 115-117 no. was
a period of over thirty years. Between the Dialogus and the
Agricola (98 A.D.) seventeen years elapsed. Moreover the
period intervening between the composition oi the two
works was occupied by the reign of Domitian, the baneful
character of which had made the deepest impression upon
Tacitus. Cf. Agr. 1 i. Under these circumstances, and
after so great a lapse oi time, his style may well have taken
on a different character. Nor are such differences without
parallel in other writers. A similar development is notice-
able in Carlyle, and the difference between his lfiffSchillcr ‘
and his Fredorick tlte Graol has been aptly compared with
that between the Dialogus and the Annals.
