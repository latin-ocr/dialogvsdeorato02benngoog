position immediately, we can hardly place the composition
after 81 Am, the beginning of Domitian's reign, since the ’
contents of the work make it extremely doubtful whether its
author would have ventured upon publication under that
emperor. The close of Domitian’s reign, 96 mo, would, on
the other hand, be out of the question, as it assumes the extra-
ordinary interval of twenty-one· or twenty-two years between
the discussion and the composition. Moreover it brings the
Dialogus within two years of the Agricola (98 mn), and
makes it impossible to account for the striking difference of
style between these two productions. It therefore seems
best to refer the composition of the Dialogus to the closing
year of Titus’s reign, 81 nm, seven years after ¹the date of
the discussion which it records It¹ has been objected that ’
this interval does not justify the use of the expression
iuvenis admodum as applied by the author to himself in
chapter 1. But if Tacitus was eighteen at the time of the
discussion, he was twenty-live when he wrote the Dialogus.
Moreover the interuening period had been an eventful one

for him. He had held various public offices, and in 78 nn.
he had married the daughter of· Agricola. lt is easy to
understand, therefore, that the maturity he had acquired in
the interim thoroughly justified him in referring to himself
seven years previously as iuvem's admodum.

IV. THE INTERLOCUTORS.

The participants in the discussion are four in number,
Marcus Aper, Julius Secundus, Vipstanus Messalla, and
Curiatius Maternus The scene is laid at the house of
Maternus,

Gallis nostris loquar), but had early come to Rome. Here
he devoted himself aeolously to the study of eloquence, and
