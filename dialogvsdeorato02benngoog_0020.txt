acquired fame as an orator and advocate, rising successively
to the offices of quaestor, tribune, and praetor. In the
Dialogus he appears in a double rdle. Against Maternus he
defends the attractions of his chosen profession as compared
with those of poetry, while against Messalla he defends the
claims of contemporary oratory¹ as compared with that of
earlier days. In style he is represented as bold, enthusiastic‚
prone to exaggeration‚ and inclined to rely upon his natural
endowments rather than upon profundity of learning.
Occasionally he stoops to sophistry, as in his remarks
upon the meaning of the term antiquus in eh. 16 ff. in
a word he represents the practical and useful, his general
attitude being well embodied in his own language (5. 5),

Jurrus SECUNDUS, like Aper, was born in Gaul, and like
him had corne to Rome and devoted himself to oratory.
In other respects the two men present the strongest con-
trast. Secundus was modest and retiring 3 he lacked Aper's
aggressiveness and apparently never held public office. As
a speaker he was deficient in fire and spontaneity, and was
distinguished rather for the purity of his diction and the
polish of his style. Hence many criticised him as lacking
in promptus sermo (2. 3), and even his friend Quintilian, who
speaks of him as mirae facundiae virum, nevertheless ex-
presses regret that he was not multo magis pugnax. Secun-
dus’s forte evidently was composition rather than delivery.
Hence he had naturally devoted himself to historical writing,
and had already won favorable comment for his Life af
Julius Africanus (14. 5). Quite consistent too with this is
the tone of chapters 36-40. 1, which are best referred to
Secundus. This entire passage, with its historical detail
and references to sources, exactly fits the character of the
historian Secundus.
