viii INTRODUCTION.

ship were rare for over two hundred years alter Lipsius's
third edition. It was not until¹ the beginning oi the present
century that a decided reaction set in in lavor ol Tacitus,
Since that time the evidence that the Dialogus is his work .
has gradually been more and more fully presented, and
more and more generally accepted as valid. Few scholars
to-day deny Tacitus’s title to the authorship.

The grounds on which the Tacitean authorship rests are
as follows :—

1. The MSS. attribute the work to Tacitus. When we
consider that the Dialogus is found almost exclusively in
MSS. which contain the Germania also, it will be seen
that the weight oi this argument is considerable.

2. Although in general the contrast in diction and style
between the Dialogus and the acknowledged writings ol
Tacitus is great, yet a careful examination reveals striking
evidences ol a common authorship, and even enables us to

. trace the genetic development ol Tacitus’s style from the

Dialogus (his earliest work) to the Annals (his latest).
