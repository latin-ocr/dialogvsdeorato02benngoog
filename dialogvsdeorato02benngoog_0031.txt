Arun's Dronsssrow (16-23). Aper first enters upon
a sophistical argument as to the meaning of the word
antiquus. He maintains that the term cannot properly
be applied to Cicero and his contemporaries; for they are
separated from the present by less than the limit ol ahuman ¹
life. The real antiqui arctiores are Appius ClaudiuS, Cat0,
Carb0, Galba, and the Gracchi. Cicero 3ηά his contem-
poraries belong rather to an intermediate era, — it anything,
nearer the present than the past. Moreover the character
of oratory varies with the times, and no single type is
to be summarily condemned simply because it differs from
another. Men always idealize the past, 3ηά underestimate
the present. The new oratory really marks a great advance
upon what preceded. lt is brilliant and elaborate in
style, whereas the earlier orators were dry and tedious An
audience of today, declares Aper, would no longer tolerate
such speakers. People now want something ornate 3ηά
striking—something to remember and talk about. Calvus
Brutus, AsiniuS, and Corvinus were all faulty, and even
Cicer0, praised though 'he is by some, is worthy of admira-
tion only in his latest speeches.

(24—3 5). Messalla, urged by Maternus to tulfill the promise
already given (in chapter 16), first defends the orators ot the
Ciceronian era against the attacks of Aper, maintaining that
all were worthy of praise, each in his way. Contemporary
oratory, on the other hand, he asserta descends to mere
tricious devices‚ and is unworthy ol respect. Reminded
again by Maternus that he had promised to set forth the
causes of the decline of eloquence‚ Messalla declares that
they are really very obvious According to his view the
prime cause is neglect in the training of the young. Formerly
the mother superintended personally the education of her
sons. Now these are given over to slaves 3ηά nurses,
