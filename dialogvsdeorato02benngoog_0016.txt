xii lNTRODUCTION.

c. In Dial. 28-30 the writer touches upon the important
part formerly played by the mother in the training oi
’ children, and with this decaying custom contrasts the
existing conditions by which children were often handed
over to nurses and worthless servants: 28. 5 non in cella
emptae nutricis, sed in gremio ac sinu matris educabatur ‚· ²9· 1
at nunc natus infans delegatur Graeculae alicui ancillae, cui
adiungitur renus aret alter ex omnibus seevcs, plerumque
vilissimus. With these passages compare the following,
where the similarity ot language as well as oi thought is par·
ticularly striking: Agr.4 mater Iuleo Procilla fuit, rarae
castitatis. In lartius sinu endrclgmtebque educatus peromnem
bonestorum ortium cultum pueritiam adulescentiamque transegit·
Ger. 20 sna quemque mater uberibus alit, nec ancillis aut
nutricibus delegantur.

el. The characterizations oi public men in the Dialogus
agree with the characterizations of the same men as found
in the Irlistories and Annals. Thus in Dc'al. 5.7 Eprius
Marcellus is accinctus et minax‚· in Anu. XVI. ²9 toruus ac
minax,· lilc'st. IV. 43 minacibus oculis. So also like judg-
ments are expressed coneeming Vatinius in Dial. 11 and
Anu. XV. 343 concerning Pomponius Secundus in Dial.
13. 4 and Aure. XII. 283 concerning Vipstanus Messalla
in Dial. 15 and Iilcst. IV. 423 while the tull account
given in Issit. IV. 43 ot the conflict in the Senate between
Helvidius Priscus and Eprius Marcellus reads like an
amplification of the allusion to the same event found in
Dial. 5.

e. It is a striking peculiarity oi the Dialogus and Annals
that they both reckon the beginning oi Augustus’s reign
from his first consulship in 43 nc„ and not from the battle
oi Actium, or from his assumption ol the title Augustus
as do other writers.
