PREFACE.

—000—

ΙΝ 1891 the editors-inchief of the College Series asked
me to prepare ior publication the manuscript notes on the
Dialogus left by· the late Professor Lucius Heritage of
the University of Wisconsin. I· acceded to their request‚
expecting that my task would consist mainly in clerical
revision. An examination of Mr. Heritage’s manuscripts

however, showed that his edition differed materially in

scope from the other books ot the series3 moreover, since

its preparation in 1883—84, the progressos critical study
on the Dialogus had been unusualiy rapid. Under these
circumstances it seemed necessary to recast the work
entirely, and I accordingly did so.

In the execution of this task Ihave received important
help from Professor Alfred Gudeman ol the University ol
Pennsylvania, who generously put at my disposal the
exhaustive materials ol his forthcoming edition oi the
Dialogus, and who has also assisted me lreely in other

ways.
