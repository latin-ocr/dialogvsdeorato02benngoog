P. CORNELII TACITI

[t. 4·

5 optimum sit senon habere? lam vero qui togatorum
comitatus et egressus quaein publico speclea, quaein
iudiciis veneratio, quod illud gaudium consurgendi
adsistendique inter tacentes et in unum conversos,
coire populum et circumfundi coram et accipere adfe-
6 ctum quemcumque orator induerit l Vulgata dicentium
gaudia et imperitorum quoque oculis exposita percenseo;
illa secretiora et tantum ipsis orantibus nota maiora
7 sunt: sive accuratam meditatamque profert orationem,
est quoddam sicut ipsius dictionis ita gaudii pondus et
constantia; sive novam et recentem curam non sine

rerum omnium abundantia:
pleonastic,— apparently a union of
two modes of expression, rerum
omnium abundantia and summa
abundantia.

5. togatorum: well-dressedciti·
zeus, as opposed to the tunicatus
populus or rabble mentioned in 7. 4.
-comitatus et egressus: these
words constitute a sort of hendi-
adys,-‘what throngs attend him
when hesets outfrom homel ' See
11. 4, where Maternus replies to
this remark of Aper's. Note also
the employment of abstract nouns
in the plural,-a characteristic
feature of Tacitean style; cf. 28.
8 educationibus ,· 28. 9 pravitatibus,
and see intr, p. xix.— consur-
gendi: for surgendi. This use of
consurgo does not appear till the
Augustan era, ag. Livy III. 71. 3.
Cf. 38. 4 deportaverat for pacaverat.
-coire populum et circum·
fundi coram, etc: note the
alliteration. 'l'he infinitives are
taken by some editors as exclam-
atory; but it is better to under-
stand quodgaudium (est) from the
preceding line, and to recognize a
change of construction from the
geruud to the inf. Such incon-

cinnity, while rare in the Dialogus,
is peculiarly characteristic of Taci-
tus’s later works Note the cli·
max: ‘assemble crowd into the
orator’s very presence, and even
follow him in his changing moods.'
The skillful speaker, like the skill-
ful actor, makes his audience share
his own emotions .

6. vulgata, well-known, further
explained by imperitorum . . .
exposita, as secretiora by tan·
turn . . . nota. The emphasis is
uponvulgata:‘it'sonlywell-known
pleasures that I am enumerating;
there are others less manifest, yet
much greater! — imperitorum
quoque, even os the unobrerving;
quoque here in the sense of vel
as in 39. 6.—dicentium, oranti-
bus: the substantive use of the
partic, as frequently in Tacitus;
see Intr, p. xx.-illa: referring to
what follows.

7. meditatam, carefullystudied,·
meditatus is passive here, as always
in Tacitus, except Dial. ιο. 10.—
profert: assubj. supply orator from
theprecedingorantibus—pondus
et constantia, wetgkt and sub-
stance—novam et recentem:
