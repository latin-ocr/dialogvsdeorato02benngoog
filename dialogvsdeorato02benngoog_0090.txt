P. CORNELII TACITI

[81. a

Epicuri quidem et Metrodori honestas quasdam exclama-
tiones adsumere iisque prout res poscit uti alienum erit
10 oratori. Neque enim sapientem informamus neque Stoi-
corum comitem, sed eum qui quasdam artes haurire,
omnes libare debet. Ideoque et iuris civilis scientiam
veteres oratores comprehendebant, et grammatica musica
11 geometria imbuebantur: incidunt enim causae, plurimae
quidem ac paene omneS, in quibus iuris notitia desi·
deratur, pleraeque autem, in quibus haec quoque scientia
32 requiritur. Nec quisquam respondeat sufficere ut ad
2 tempus simplex quiddam et uniforme doceamur. Pri-
mum enim aliter utimur propriis, aliter commodatis,

phon’s style has been recognized
in all ages; cf. Quint. X. 1. 28 quid
ego commemorem Xenophontis iu-
cunditateminaffi’ctatomi—Metro·
dori: of Lampsacus, anillustrious
disciple of Epicurus. Cicero, de
Fin. II. 92, calls him paene alter
Epicurus. —honestas quasdam:
implying that in the main the doc·
trinos of this school were not such
θ as a worthy man might avail him-
self of. - exclamationes: short,
pithy expressions in which Epi-

’ curus and his disciples were fond

of embodying their tenets, eg. is
maxime divitiis fruitur qui minime
divitiis indiget, Sen. Ep. 14. 17.-
poscit: the present for the future
as occasionally in the Latin of all
periods.

ιο. neque enim: supply in
sense: ‘This eclecti'c methodos
procedure is justifiable.'— sapien-
tem: i.e. an ideal philosopher. —
Stoicorum comitem, a sollower
of tlte Stoics. According to Mes·
salla, it is enough for the orator,
without being a man oi perfect

wisdom (sapientem), or without ·

adhering to a single system of phi-
losophy, as eg. the Stoic, to take

from the different systems what·
ever may serve his purpose.—
haurire, libare: i.e. to study some
branchos exhaustively and to dip
into others; ct. our ‘Know every-
thing about something, and some
thing about everything.'

ιι. incidunt . .. desideratur: log-
icallysubordinate to pleraeque . . .
requiritur, though grammatically
coordinata. The thought ist ‘For
while there are many cases—most,
in fact - in which a knowledge ot
civil law is necessary, yet many
occur in which a knowledge ot
these other branches (grammar,
music, geometry) is also essential’
-haec scientia: i.e. harum artium
(grammaticae, nauticae, geometriae)
scientia; ci. Cic. de Or. Ι. 10 ci
scientiae, ie. eius ortis (mathema-
ticae) scientiae.

32. nec: ἱοιφιιιι,Ι asin ¹38
and frequently.—ut ad tempus,
etc: i.e. secure some simple and
elementary instruction in asubject
according to one’s temporary need.
-uniforme, simple, a synonyrn ot
simplex. The word is not found
elsewhere except in much later
writers.
