rat. Magna eloquentia, sicut flamma, materia alitur et
motibus excitatur et urendo clarescit. Eadem ratio in
nostra quoque civitate antiquorum eloquentiam pro
vexit. Nam etsi horum quoque temporum oratores ea
consecuti sunt quae composita et quieta et beata re
publica tribui fas erat, tamen illa perturbatione ac
licentia plura sibi adsequi videbantur, cum mixtis omni-

one should sacrifice one's own
child in order to stay a pestilence,
eto-cum ad iudices ven-
tum: the sentence probably
closed with some such thought
as: ‘theu we see how scant their
equipment is! The conclusion oi
Messalla's speech, and the begin-
ning of the following are lost.
The lacuna was oi several pages
in extent, six in one MS.

-humile, abiectum: a iavorite
combination oi Cicero: cf. dc Fin.
V. 57 nihil humile, nihil abiectum ,·
Or. 192 humilem et abiectam ora-
tionem. — poterat: the subj. ot
this verb was probably the name

thenes or some other; ci. the

such moderate distinction as it was
possible to attain under existing
conditions, implying that in a

well-ordered and tranquil gov-
ernment such opportunities were
more restricted thau formerly. —
illa: iu. under the Republic‚
as opposed to horum temporum
above.— plura sibi adsequi vi-
debantur: the thought is inac-
curately expressed. The earlier
Roman orators, who must be un-
derstood as referred to in vide-
bantur, could obviously not have
compared themselves with a later
generation, as enjoying larger privi-
leges (plura adsequi). The writer
means rather: ‘secured greater
rewards, as it seems to me.' For
a similar use oi uideri. cf. Caes.
B. G. l. 40 cum meritus videbatur,
i.e. deserved, as it seems lo me.
- omnibus τ for omnibus rebus:
cf. 37. 4 his. Neuter plural adiec-
tives are rarely used substan-
tively by earlier writers in any case
except the nom. or acc.. where the
termination shows thegender. The
writers ot the Silver Age, however,
employ the other cases with some
ireedom, eg. Tac. Agr. 35 firmus
adversis,· Seneca, de Benef. II. 5.
2 sublimium cursum ,· Quint. XI.
