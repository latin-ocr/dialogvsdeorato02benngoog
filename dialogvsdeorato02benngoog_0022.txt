xviii INTRODUCTION.

language in 37. 9 f. plures tamen lanas praeliatores bella quam
pauserunt. Similis eloquentiae condicio to Maternus, it is sur-
prising to find the same speaker in 40. 7 repeating sub-
stantially the same idea in a weakened form ε tulit sine dubio
ualentiorem elequentiam, etc. So also 41. 6 quid (opus est)
uoluntariis accusationibus, cum tam rara et parce peccetur?
41. 5 quid multis apeeapapulam cantionibus? can hardly have
been spoken by the same person as ram uera cautiones adsi-
duae et clatum ins¹ patentissimum quemque vexandi atquc ipsa

¹ inimicitiarum gloria, in 40. 1. But ii we attribute the latter

passage to Secundus and regard the former as Matemus's

¹ - κ , rejoinder‚ all difficulty disappears

Again‚ ii we attribute chapters 36 ff. to Maternus, we find
him giving utterance to sentiments at variance with those
previously expressed by him in the course oi the discussion.
Thus the enthusiastic allusion to the influence oi the earlier
orators in 36. 5, ln‘ clientelis ctiam exterarum nationum redun-
dabant, lcos ituri in pronuncias magistratus reverebantur, tos
reuersi colebant, lios et praeturae et consulatus uacare ultra uide- ¹
bantur, is inconsistent with the contempt oi such honors ὲ
expressed in 13. 2, licet illas certamina et pericula sna ad can-
snlntus evexerint. .

2. Furthermore chapters 36-40. 1 accord excellently with
the character oi Secundus as historian and antiquarian, in
which he appears in the discussion. The chapters in
question are in the nature oi an historical re'sume oi the
development and course oi oratory at Rome.

We shall therefore do best to recognize Secundus as the
speaker in all that follows the lacuna at the beginning ol ,
chapter 36 as iar as 40. 1quas aratoribus faces admovebant. ³
At this point we must assume a second lacuna and assign
to Maternus ,the passage from 40. 2 (nnn de otiosa etc.) to
the close oi 41.
